## Poverty Rate
**What you're seeing:** The percentage of adults (ages 18–64) in each county who live below the federal poverty line (based on a 5-year average from 2006–2010).

**Why it matters:** Poverty is a key factor that can influence crime rates and arrest patterns. This data helps show how economic conditions and justice system practices may be connected.

## Arrest Rate
**What you're seeing:** The number of adult felony arrests per 100,000 residents (ages 18–69) in each county.

**Why it matters:** This helps to understand how often counties use arrests as a response to crime, and the size of the population moving through the criminal justice system.

## Reported Crime Rate
**What you're seeing:** The number of Part I crimes (aggravated assault, forcible rape, murder, robbery, arson, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft) reported to police for each county per 100,000 adults (ages 18–69).

**Why it matters:** This helps to understand how much crime is reported in each county and serves as an indicator of community exposure to crime. It also provides context for understanding local incarceration and policing practices.

## Unsentenced Population
**What you're seeing:** The percentage of people in county jails who have not been sentenced but are still being held shown as a percentage of each county's average daily jail population as of Dec. 31.

**Why it matters:** Many of these individuals may be in jail simply because they can't afford bail or are waiting for their case to move through the system. This data highlights issues of fairness and delays in the pretrial process.

## Prisoners Held Locally
**What you're seeing:** The percentage of incarcerated adults in each county who are held in county jails instead of state prisons. Jail populations are shown as a percent of each county's total incarcerated population (state prison + county jail) as of Dec. 31.

**Why it matters:** This metric highlights the extent to which counties rely on local incarceration compared to state prison.

## Jail Populations
**What you're seeing:** The number of people in county jail per 100,000 adults (ages 18–69), measured on December 31 each year.

**Why it matters:** This demonstrates how often counties use jail as a form of incarceration, and how that practice differs from place to place.

## New Felony Admissions
**What you're seeing:** The number of people sent to state prison for new felony convictions per 1,000 adult felony arrests for the calendar year.

**Why it matters:** This helps show how many felony arrests lead to prison sentences, offering a snapshot of current sentencing practices.

## Total Incarceration Rate
**What you're seeing:** The combined number of people in state prison and county jail per 1,000 adult felony arrests (as of Dec. 31).

**Why it matters:** This gives an overall picture of how heavily each county relies on incarceration in response to crime.

## County Jail Incarceration Rate
**What you're seeing:** The number of people held in county jails per 1,000 adult felony arrests (as of Dec. 31).

**Why it matters:** This rate reflects how much counties rely on local jails to detain people, whether pretrial or post-sentencing.

## State Prison Incarceration Rate
**What you're seeing:** The number of people held in state prisons per 1,000 adult felony arrests, compared to the state average.

**Why it matters:** This shows how often a county send people to state prison and how that compares to other counties.

## State Prison Population
**What you're seeing:** The number of people from each county held in state prison per 100,000 adults (ages 18–69), as of Dec. 31.

**Why it matters:** This shows how heavily each county relies on state incarceration and how that reliance compares across the state.

## Imprisonment Costs
**What you're seeing:** The estimated cost of state imprisonment per adult felony arrest, using statewide cost estimates from the Legislative Analyst's Office.

**Why it matters:** Counties that send more people to prison create higher costs for state taxpayers. This helps reveal the financial impact of local sentencing practices.

## Education (High School Diploma or Less)
**What you're seeing:** The percentage of adults in each county whose highest level of education is a high school diploma or less.

**Why it matters:** Education levels can impact job opportunities, income, and involvement in the justice system. This data helps show the social and economic conditions that may shape local justice outcomes.

## Employment (Unemployment Rate)
**What you're seeing:** The percentage of adults in each county who are unemployed and actively looking for work.

**Why it matters:** High unemployment can be linked to economic hardship and increased system involvement. Understanding employment trends helps contextualize arrest and incarceration rates.

## Politics (% Who Voted Republican)
**What you're seeing:** The percentage of voters in each county who supported the Republican candidate in the most recent gubernatorial (2022) or presidential (2024) election.

**Why it matters:** Political leanings can influence county-level policies on crime, incarceration, and public safety. This gives insight into how local politics may shape justice system practices.

## Immigration (% Noncitizen Population)
**What you're seeing:** The percentage of county residents who are noncitizens, including undocumented immigrants and legal permanent residents.

**Why it matters:** Immigration status can affect access to resources, legal protections, and exposure to policing. This data helps uncover disparities in justice system outcomes for immigrant communities.
