The California Sentencing Institute (CASI) is a powerful tool for understanding how incarceration impacts communities across California. Developed by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice (CJCJ), CASI offers interactive maps and data visualizations that allow users to examine crime and incarceration trends in all 58 California counties.

By making this data available to the public, CASI helps advocates, community leaders, policymakers, and researchers push for equity-focused justice policies that reduce reliance on incarceration and promote long-term community safety.

Since 1985, CJCJ has produced leading research to promote more effective approaches to criminal and juvenile justice policies in California. CASI, launched in 2009, continues that mission by offering county-by-county insights that can be used to understand sentencing patterns, promote equity, and drive change at the local and state levels.
