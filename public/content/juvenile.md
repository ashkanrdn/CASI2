# Juvenile Justice in California

In 1858, California opened its first juvenile justice facility, the San Francisco Industrial School, to care for orphaned, abused, neglected, and delinquent children. In 1903, California became one of the first states to establish a separate court system for youthful offenders, acknowledging that youth were distinct from adults and deserving of individualized attention and rehabilitation.

The Industrial School closed in 1892 following 30 years of documented abuse and mismanagement, but its model of congregate institutional care remains the foundation of the state's youth correctional facilities. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, following concern about the rise of youth crime and system leniency, several punitive laws were passed including mandatory sentenced and automatic adult court transfers for certain crimes and the state institutional population began to grow.




In the 1990s, youth crime rates began to plummet. However, counties continued to heavily rely on state-run institutional care and the state facilities became overcrowded—peaking at 150% of design capacity. Violence in the facilities skyrocketed and rehabilitation became difficult.

In 1996, a sliding scale fee was introduced to provide accountability to counties who were unnecessarily sending low-level youth to the state facilities. In 2003, the [Farrell litigation](https://www.cjcj.org/reports-publications/publications/update-to-cjcjs-farrell-litigation-timeline), a class action lawsuit was filed against the state facilities alleging the system was prison-like, violent, and failed to educate or rehabilitate its wards. The state entered into a consent decree, acknowledging the system's failures and agreeing to replace it with a modern, rehabilitative system. These events caused a dramatic decline in the state institutional population.

In 2007, Senate Bill 81 was passed, realigning non-violent, non-serious youth offenders to the local level and providing funding to county probation systems to improve their capacity to serve youth offenders. The bill ressulted in a further decline in institutional commitments and spurred the development of innovative programs at the county level. 
In 2008, The Little Hoover Commision called for the closure of the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ), with 7 facilities closing between 2003-2011. While the Farrell lawsuit oversight ended in 2016, the culture of staff abuse and violence continued in DJJ. In 2020, Governor Newsom, recognizing its long history of harm and failure, proposed to close California’s youth prison system. SB 823 (2020) and SB 92 (2021) outline the shift to an entirely county based system. 

DJJ closed officially on June 30th, 2023, making California the first state to close a state-operated youth prison system. Monitoring for juvenile justice sentencing and detainment practices are now being tracked at a county level.
