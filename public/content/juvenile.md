# Juvenile Justice in California

In 1858, California opened its first juvenile justice facility, the San Francisco Industrial School, to care for orphaned, abused, neglected, and delinquent children. In 1903, California became one of the first states to establish a separate court system for youthful offenders.

In the 1990s, youth crime rates began to plummet. However, counties continued to heavily rely on state-run institutional care and the state facilities became overcrowdedâ€”peaking at 150% of design capacity.

DJJ closed officially on June 30th, 2023, making California the first state to close a carceral system. Monitoring for juvenile justice sentencing and detainment practices are now being tracked at a county level.
