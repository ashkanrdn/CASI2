# California Sentencing History

In July 1852, California opened its first land-based adult correctional institution, San Quentin State Prison, housing 68 individuals. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s California experienced low incarceration rates, and by 1940 state prisons housed only 8,180 people.

In 1977, the Determinate Sentencing Law (DSL) passed in California, eliminating rehabilitation as a goal of sentencing in favor of more punitive practices that emphasized incarceration. Consequently, incarceration rates soared resulting in overcrowding and a deterioration of conditions within the state's prisons and jails.
In May 2011, pursuant to the Plata litigation the United States Supreme Court mandated that California reduce its prison population by more than 30,000 due to unconstitutional prison conditions. In response, Governor Brown passed Assembly Bill 109 (AB 109), which realigned responsibility for adult non-serious, non-violent, non-sex offenders to the county level. AB 109 was implemented on October 1, 2011. 

Other efforts to reduce prison overcrowding and reduce recidivism in the state include 
Proposition 47, which changed certain low-level offenses from potential felonies (such as drug possession and thefts of property valued under $950) to misdemeanors. Prop 47 implemented on November 4th, 2014. 

Passed by voters in November 2016, Proposition 57 was known as the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act. It created new parole considerations for people convicted of non-violent felony offenses sentenced to state prison and provided state corrections officials with authority to award credits for good behavior and participation in programming and educational attainments that would reduce the length of an individual’s state prison sentence. Prop 57 also amended state law to require youth to have a hearing in juvenile court, to be overseen by a judge, to decide if young people charged with certain crimes should be tried in juvenile or adult court; previously this discretion rested with the prosecutor. 

We are currently waiting to see the impact of Proposition 36, which was passed by voters in November 2024 and increased penalties on certain drug and property offenses, while creating a new category of crimes called a “treatment mandated felony”, that has the potential to impact jail and prison populations.
