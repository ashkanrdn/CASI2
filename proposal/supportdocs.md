How to write winning proposals 
I'm just going to wait for some people to uh just waiting for people to join if anyone sees this or wants help with a proposal just uh leave it in the comments I wanted to to start thinking about this kind of stuff soon all right so I mean have some free time this afternoon so I just wanted to talk a little about how I think about writing proposals and most of the proposals that I write are informed from a book called Consulting Bible so let me just uh find that real quick by Alan Weiss yeah so let me sh my screen this book right here uh this is the one I the one I read uh I basically did it and it works really really well and the specific thing they talk about dismiss I don't want to dox myself um and that book basically talks about the importance of generating a proposal that is really high quality and it's high quality because it has a lot of different sections there's a situational assessment there's a measure of the objectives the metrics of success and the values and benefits you're going to derive from that project then you list out the methodologies how you plan to do it then you list out timing and then you list out price and so there's a lot of stuff going on so if I go to situational assessments alen Weiss let me think of situational assessment illin noise uh PDF samples um this is basically everything right situational appraisal objectives values metrics timing accountability credentials terms conditions and acceptance and the real benefit of something like this is it really helped you be able to communicate your understanding of what the customer actually wants right and it's never like a list of tasks it's always some kind of outcome and what you can do is you can always first specify that in the situational summary then you can list out the objectives and the things that the company wants then you list out you know in this example they also look at the methodologies right so this is what the company wants and this is what you're going to do right you want to some like separate these two things because if you just sell the list of actions like that's when you start selling time if you sell the objectives first and then explain what you're going to do now the actions you take are in service of the objective that the company cares about then it's a matter of measuring the metrics for Success right you can you can talk about the outcomes in the value to the customer and then you can think about things like timing and and accountabilities and conditions and this is basically what I do for almost all of my proposals right here there's like a in the methodology one thing that is also really valuable is to make sure you have multiple options right um because if you don't if you only have one option they can only pay you a certain amount of money but if you're actually able to offer more value you can do that by providing options because now they don't have to just say no to your entire proposal they can so say no to the things that feel expensive or the things that don't feel like fair or valuable but they can still choose some of the options that do make sense for them right so here this option one option two option three option four and right now there's like no price listed because what you really want to do is you want to paint a picture of again what they're trying to get out of the system then afterwards you again you can start asking for things and then at the bottom this is where you think about you know how much do these things actually cost and really your ability to command a higher salary is is again based on what I said yesterday is mostly going to be based off of the fact that you are trying to be as accountable and as responsible as for the outcome as possible for example if you go back to this you know if you ask really bad questions let me just let me just check the conversation by the way yeah if you ask really bad questions during your sales process then you're going to have a really bad proposal and the more you care about writing a good proposal the more or more specific the questions are going to be right when companies come to me I usually ask you know what's at stake in your business and why are you reaching out to me right what happened and that question tells you a lot right sometimes it's the CTO has left the company sometimes it's oh we just raised a series a we're trying to figure out what to do or if we're about to raise a series a we want to prepare for that and all of a sudden like this size becomes a lot bigger right because if there just someone who's oh I'm just curious nothing's at stake then how can you ask for anything right they're not going to make any money how do you ask but if they just said okay well I raised $40 million and my job is to hire 10 more people in the next year you already know like how big the problem is and not only that like if you think about a recruiter 10 employees might be $3 million and the recruiter gets 20% of that that's a lot of fucking money right but what the recruiter does is it says okay the situation is going to be that this company has a raised a bunch of money and they need to scale out their team so it's very important for them to hire credible people with lots of experience the goal is to hire 10 people in the next eight months to be able to do this job if they're doing it successfully they're going to go on and build a great product get their series B go public everyone's a millionaire if you can frame it from that perspective then you can offer you know different guarantees and options for example the recruiter can say well I understand that a success means that you're going to actually end up hiring them and success also means that they not going to leave so they can they can think about okay maybe the offer I want to pull out that is maximally accountable is one where I ask for 20% of the salary they allocate and you know I'll give you the money back if someone leaves right 20% of $3 million in the next year is a lot of lot of money but if they're not accountable Maybe maybe they're just charging you based on a list of actions we will reach out to 30 people who gives a fuck right I will do 50 phone calls if they if they said we'll do a phone we'll do 30 phone screens and each phone screen costs 60 bucks you know you don't really know whether or not they're just going to do more phone screens because they want to make more money or maybe maybe the recruiter is super successful and you don't matter to them and so maybe they're not doing phone screens because they're not excited by the outcomes right now you're asking yourself all this other shit but if the recruiter says I want 20% this is what success means this is what I know this is what you want you know it becomes way more clear and so in their options they might be able to present options that are lower touch right screens I'm going to send you qualified leads everyone to passes the phone screen I want $100 and the higher and I'll like find the executive I'll build the team and so the situation is to you know spend $3 million in the next year on headcount to build up towards a profitable business the size is very big another question I asked is just like what does success look like right and not only that but like how can I make you look good then you can start thinking about the the values and the metrics for what success looks like right because again in the interviewing Suess metrics is not number of resumés it's probably closer to number of job interviews or the number of qualified leads right but again it's just really good to sort of highlight again that you kind of you know what the AO outcomes are and so now you know what the objectives are the goal is to you know hire a team of five or six people in order to raise their series B the value is you know being able to find the talent quickly is going to allow us to develop the product faster is going to you know get improve our our go to market maybe in a very competitive space getting getting even a couple months ahead in in Market actually has compounding effects but the metrics now become you know whether or not we are able to give the offers out whether or not they accept the offer and whether or not they stay at the company long enough right kind might be you know wanting to find the the client in the next 3 months or six months Etc and then the accountabilities become you know well I'm going to give you updates or I'm going to give you a lot of updates or I'm going to give you infrequent updates with a lot of information right to understand more about the accountabilities a good question to ask them is okay what do you look for in a part right maybe what they realize is like oh this person's like a micro manager they want to have an approval for every decision that we make or maybe they're so busy with other things they just want to be sent you know a end of week overview of who who to interview right maybe they want to be interrupted if there's a great candidate you know I want you to be able to you know text me right away and say this guy is great like jump on the call or maybe I want to be say okay I never want you to do that I'm super busy again if you ask the question like what do you look for in a partner you can change the accountability section in a way that is beneficial to you and not only that if you understand what what they look for in a business partner you can also change different options and methodologies that you can sell right like I said before like if they want very little contact or a lot of contact you can just make that optional things and then you can sort of separate out and package things and bundle things in a way that makes sense um let me find an example of one that I really like yeah this is basically the one that I I structured my my proposal against right what is the situation objectives measures of success and value to X right the value of this project appears to be multifold improve supervision faster appropriate responses retention of key Talent right you know you can you can talk about status you can talk about the money you save you can talk about the money you make right tons of different things and then you can effectively create the methodology and and and notice here one thing that's really important to to make the distinction between trading your time for money versus pricing against pricing yourself against outcomes is the outcome is worth something you're investing a small proportion of that outcome to make it more successful and to get this outcome it's going to take six months right what they didn't say is I'm GNA charge you $8,000 a month that's that's that's again an hourly thing right here it says like I never assess an hourly or daily fee since you should not make an investment decision every how my assistance may be needed nor should your people have to seek permission to spend money if they need my help instead you say you're going to spend a shit ton of money and 45k is just a bit of what you're going to invest to make that more successful and here are the three options and this is basically if you look at my website it kind of just looks like this right there's medium there's low touch medium touch High touch and the pricing affects that right like you know this is a an incremental change this is a much larger change and then one thing I find really helpful honestly is this line here a lot of companies that are bigger like not startups but like bigger companies they'll think about offering you like net 60 or net 30 but because you've structured your deal like this you can't really say oh $8,000 every month for five months and then within three months if you cancel like you lose out the money or whatever instead you can say you know 50% upfront 50% due on acceptance and then a 15 so I offer a 15% discount when the fee is paid up front and people do it right because for example if for if a c if a if a client knows they want to work with me like they know the money is going to leave and unless they're short on cash and most companies that are like VC backed or like you know large hedge funds or whatever they are funded and so to them it should just look like just free money like they're already committed you're making it easier and now with the extra money you can like invest it make some other bets and it's actually pretty easy to negotiate these terms because chances are these companies just have these default contracts right it's not like the PM or the founder is trying to screw you by adding net 60 is just the default contract these are contracts for independent contractors right these are people that are doing work right but again I think having these multiple options and having these terms is super successful okay so what you're going to probably end up doing is you're going to end up writing a bunch of these proposals over time and you're going to start just wishing to ask to ask certain questions like again the questions are going to be like what's at stake what does SU best look like how can I make you really look good and and what kind of qualities do you look for in a partner you know all these what kind of timing do you want you know what what is the expected return on the investment you're going to make and how much of that are you willing to put towards making this more successful making this a little bit easier having having this happen a little bit faster all these questions are going to inform how you can write your proposal and then what I do specifically Ally is I will always you know do these calls and save the meeting transcripts and then what I have is I I have this entire PDF plus a bunch of instructions plus like seven other proposals that were accepted I put that into a cloud project and uh I just now have a cloud project that takes in transcripts and generat the first draft of the proposal and again the conversations you have are effectively getting the information you need to extract or extracting the information you need to generate a proposal right and the idea is like as you increase the options you increase the price because you are increasing the the likelihood sorry the the accountability and the responsibility for these outcomes right it's never going to be like I will do X and Y if I try to make a simpler analogy with something like you know a trainer like a bad trainer might be like a bad trainer basically comes to you and says hey I'm a trainer I work out of this gym and this gym has like 10 squat racks right but if someone say like oh hey like why did you why are you looking for a personal trainer oh you're trying to lose some weight is there any occasion or do you just are you feeling unhealthy or is this like inury prevention oh you're you're going on a honeymoon when's the honeymoon oh in in eight weeks okay okay now you know so many things you know the timing you know the outcomes right oh where you going like oh like Lake Como like wow your wedding must be like a $200,000 right in which case there's different things you can do right because if you sawell a list of actions maybe the answer is hey like I don't know that's let think about it yeah I will work out with you 40 minutes every other day and each workout is $250 an hour and there's a late fee right like you're only going to make so much money because that's going to be a function of like the clients you have times the dollar rate times like how many days you're in the gym but if you start pricing things like okay you know what like is this like your honey moon or something maybe I mean like I don't really know the personal trainer exam because I'm not going to make any more money this is like purely an emotional decision but I guess my point here really would be to you know structure a deal in a way that says hey if your goal is to feel great and be confident and like you know enjoy your like a hot summer body you want this done in six weeks here's a plan to do it in six weeks right here are some Milestones that we care about and they feel like you don't have to pay me anything but my goal is to get you these Milestones right and maybe you start thinking about like performance bonuses maybe it is if you're able to lose 10 pounds you know you can do this if you want to lose 10 pounds you can do that right uh even you don't pay me until there's some outcome that's been accepted and if you really believe in my ability to deliver this like here's a discount if you want to like pay up front again like I don't really do personal training but I think those are the analogies I try to think about right it's like obviously it might not be good to start selling to people who want to like go to the honeymoon because there's really no nothing but emotional investment but you know you can imagine for a personal trainer for a movie it's very different right because the movie's budget is like a h hundred million do and your lead needs to get jacked in the next six weeks and the question is like what happens if they're not jacked right do you delay production do you set the movie back six weeks what if they lose a bunch of weight but in a really poor way and they're really tired like how much is that going to cost you but then you realize that if you do that chances are you're not paying them like $200 an hour right because they're GNA give you a ton of different options to hit your goal now it's like well sure my time is worth this much but I'm actually going to get you to a workout plan I'll I'll take you to and from the gym I will bring you a chef I will you know have a private gym so you don't get paparazzi coming at you I'll bring you to cryo we'll set us some time for sauna I'll make sure that the caterer has options and you can add all these other features because you understand what outcome they're trying to drive rather than just going like well I'm a personal trainer my rate is 250 because that's not actually aligned with the outcomes but if it becomes my job is to get you on set feeling strong looking good and I'll make sure I can plan things around the the scenes that you do I'll get you nutritionalist I'll get you cryo now all these other things are things that you can charge for because they're actually valuable to the customer right and you give you can give them these options and now it's just a matter of like whether or not the business wants to invest this much money and I don't know I don't know if like personal training is like half a percent of the production but like half a percent is a fuck ton of money for like a movie budget anyways that's kind of all I really have to say about it I don't know if anyone has questions but yeah like a lot of it like in the Consulting that I've done in the past you know it's oh like you have a rag app and the quality is bad and it's hurting user trust and how much is user trust worth like I'm not going to solve it for $100 an hour right because I don't really come and say oh I sell I build apps for people if you say I build apps for rich people like that's not good enough either it right like really what you want is like I fix things for people who stand to make lots of money right like or I I automate things for people who are paying lots of money to do this manually then you can just figure out like okay what kind of customers do I have what kind of services do I offer that the customers I want are customers that have users with big problems and the services they offer have to be aligned with driving those business outcomes rather than saying I am a python developer right but a year ago like I was a python developer I was charging like 170 an hour I nervously got myself to 250 an hour but then at some point it's like no no like I'm here to get you a series a your series a is probably going to be $20 million like what are you looking to invest in this project oh what can I do to get you there okay what I can do what can I do okay I can build you a road map that can both impress your investors be realistic and help use that road map to close the talent right because a lot of AI Engineers don't want to come in and feel like they're supposed to be doing magic and it's really hard to find find a head of AI but I have this presence on Twitter or like I'll be on podcast and and I can do a lot to Market your goals right but I'm not going to like try $250 an hour and if I mention your job listing at a podcast like that doesn't like what's the dollar amount to that doesn't make any sense but if I could say I'm gonna do all these things and here's some other things I can do and here's some other things I can do now you're building out offerings that make you feel like the likelihood of your dream is just increasing over time that's that's how I think about it anyways that's my rant I'm going to use this transcript to turn into a blog post so uh thanks for listening I don't know how many people are actually watching this thing but if anyone has questions just like tweet at me all

21 sources
The collected sources offer a comprehensive look at the modern practice of AI consulting, focusing heavily on effective pricing strategies and structuring client engagements. Several sources, including articles and video transcripts from Jason Liu and others, advocate for moving away from time-based billing to value-based pricing, where fees are tied to quantifiable outcomes and risk mitigation rather than mere tasks. The material also includes concrete examples of consulting proposals, such as the Bluwatr and CASI projects, which utilize a structured approach of assessing the client's pain points, proposing tiered options (the Airline Model), and defining joint accountabilities. Furthermore, the documents detail the importance of thought leadership and content creation as a means to build trust and generate leads, while also discussing the operational aspects of running an independent practice, from establishing a consulting stack of tools to handling legal concerns like NDAs.

to me, Nancy, Mike

Greetings Ashkan,

I hope you're well today, brother. I'm excited for how close we are to finished with our project! And also hoping we can come together to meet to see where we are with CASI. I have a feeling that we haven't gotten to the data checking portion of CASI, which we have always been concerned would take some time. I think we need to have a meeting to discuss where we are with that. I also looked at the site with a new font, they look great! I also noticed the graphs are not on there yet for the juvenile justice and adult history that I shared, will they be added soon? 

Can you reply to this email and let us know some of your availability for next week or the week after? I don't think the meeting should take too long. If we need to start working on downloading the data to be checked and doing it outside of a program, we absolutely need to start on that now so I'd love a meeting to find out where things are. Thank you so much, looking forward to the conversation. Have a beautiful weekend. 


Another Email from Tina:

I hope you are well. Do you think that we should have a meeting about the program for checking the data? I know my colleague made the video with where to get it, but we didn't really discuss it after I sent it to you. Please let me know where we're at with this and if we need to meet to have a discussion on how to get this data, or if the way that she sent instructions in that video is not helpful, or if we need to provide the data ourselves if the video instructions didn't work. Thanks so much, have a blessed day.


Previous years data and format :

Good Day Ashkan & Mike,

I hope you are well today. I am reaching out to connect you two as it seems this will be the quickest way to get the old CASI data reformatted. In previous conversations with Ashkan, he had mentioned that it would be best for it to be formatted in the same way as the new CASI data so it could be plugged right into the site and match the data for how we will format it for going forward as well. Mike has said the below information regarding the old CASI data, but honestly, Nancy and myself are not who should be having these types of conversations, it should be you two. I think we've reached our expertise limits.  I have cc'd you both and Mike's comment below in hopes that Ashton and Mike can discuss how to best format the old data to match the newer data for our site. Thanks so much, have a great day. Please let me know if you have any questions. 


CASI master file for 2009-
2016 | assembled a couple of years ago. I believe the most compatible reformatting is to have six column variables: status (adult or juvenile), year, county, measure (variable), type of measure (rate or count), and value (the value for each variable). In the interests of time, we could do only adult, and only those measures for which we have data for all years. Each of the variables shown in column A would be transposed and stacked vertically in the Measure column, and its type of measure stacked vertically in the Type of Measure column, and corresponding value stacked vertically in the Value column. If that works, I can start work on stacking the variables and measures.
