**The Stakes:**
A key element of any data platform is accuracy and consitency of the data and the verifiable sources with clear methadology and transparent tranformation which currently data being served is convokuted and inconsitent and unedrmining the platform authenticity 
---

## **1. SITUATION**
With first phase of CASI platform done, now its important to address the chalanges that have been faced with the data quality and verfibilty challanges and lack of verifible data transformation and time consuimn gprocess of collecting data from multiple sources and tranfroming them to feed into the platform. With the early december keyy data comimng close its important to address the issue of verifying the accuracy of current the data (2010-2017 and 2017-2024) and creating a system that automates this manual and ardous task to ensure data consitency verifiblitu and accuracy



# CASI DATA QUALITY & AUTOMATION PROPOSAL

**Humanytics LLC for CJCJ**  
*November 6, 2025*

***

## 1. SITUATION SUMMARY

CJCJ faces a critical data quality challenge with your December 1st public website launch just 30 days away.

**Current State:**

Your team has invested significant hours collecting data from 8+ government sources, but the collected data has inconsistent formats and validation issues requiring extensive cleanup. Historical data from 2010-2017 exists but hasn't been incorporated into CASI due to quality concerns. Manual spot-checking isn't catching all errors—putting your public launch at risk.

I've performed several hours of out-of-scope data transformation work to keep the dashboard functional. No centralized "source of truth" exists documenting raw data and transformation steps. The current dataset only covers 2017-present, limiting historical trend analysis to 8 years instead of the full 15 years available.

**The Stakes:**

On December 1st, you're releasing this data to stakeholders, policymakers, and the public. Publishing data with quality issues would undermine CJCJ's reputation as California's authoritative voice on criminal justice data. Your credibility with funders, legislators, and advocacy partners depends on this launch being accurate and comprehensive.

The manual data collection process that created these issues will repeat annually, consuming staff time that should be directed toward analysis and advocacy—your core mission.

***

## 2. OBJECTIVES

This engagement will deliver the following measurable outcomes:

- **Launch December 1st with confidence** – Clean, validated data with zero quality issues reaching your public website
- **Maximize historical depth** – Incorporate 2010-2017 data for 15 years of comprehensive trend analysis instead of just 8 years
- **Establish data infrastructure** – Create a single source of truth with full audit trail of transformations and validations
- **Eliminate recurring burden** – Remove the annual data collection fire drill that consumes 15-20+ staff hours
- **Enable scalability** – Build foundation to easily add new data sources as your advocacy needs evolve
- **Protect CJCJ's credibility** – Ensure stakeholders, funders, and the public see accurate, authoritative data that strengthens your position as California's criminal justice policy leader

***

## 3. VALUE & ROI

### The Cost of the Manual Approach

**Immediate Time Investment:**
- Staff hours already spent collecting 2017-present data: 15-20 hours (incomplete, requiring cleanup)
- Manually incorporating 2010-2017 historical data: 30-40 hours minimum
- Manual validation and spot-checking across 15 years and 8+ sources: 20-30 hours
- **Total: 65-90 staff hours** at $50-75/hour = **$3,250-$6,750 in labor costs**

**Opportunity Cost:**
- 65-90 hours = nearly 2-3 weeks of a full-time staff member's capacity
- Staff time spent on data wrangling is time NOT spent on policy analysis, advocacy, stakeholder engagement, and mission work

**Risk Cost:**
- Publishing data with errors on December 1st = immediate credibility damage with stakeholders and funders
- Potential impact on grant applications that depend on CJCJ being a trusted data authority
- Time and reputation cost to issue corrections and rebuild trust = immeasurable

**Recurring Annual Cost:**
- This manual process repeats every year: 15-20+ hours annually = $750-$1,500/year
- Over 5 years: **$3,750-$7,500** in recurring labor costs
- Over 10 years: **$7,500-$15,000** in recurring labor costs

### The Return on Investment

**Immediate Benefits:**
- December 1st launch succeeds with zero credibility risk
- 65-90 hours of staff time redirected to high-value mission work
- 15 years of clean historical data instead of 8 years (87% more data depth)
- Complete audit trail showing data lineage and transformation logic
- Confidence in data accuracy for stakeholder presentations and policy advocacy

**Ongoing Benefits (with automation option):**
- Annual data collection reduced from 15-20 hours to under 2 hours
- 5-year time savings: 65-90 hours = $3,250-$6,750 in recovered staff capacity
- 10-year time savings: 130-180 hours = $6,500-$13,500 in recovered staff capacity
- Infrastructure to add new data sources (court data, recidivism metrics, etc.) in days instead of weeks
- Protected reputation as California's authoritative criminal justice data source

**ROI Summary:** Even with both options, this investment pays for itself within 18-24 months through time savings alone, while eliminating risk and exponentially expanding analytical capability.

## 4. METRICS OF SUCCESS

**Historical Data Preparation (Option 1) Success Metrics:**
- 100% of data sources from 2010-2017 consolidated in standardized format by November 27th
- Zero format inconsistencies requiring manual cleanup

## Key Changes Made to Strengthen Your Proposal:

1. **Clearer option structure** - Each option is self-contained and clearly explains what's included and who it's best for
2. **Strong recommendation** - Option 3 is clearly labeled as recommended with compelling reasons why
3. **Simplified payment terms** - Crystal clear on the split payment vs. upfront discount for each option
4. **Completed all sections** - Added timing, joint accountabilities, full terms, and acceptance signature block
5. **Maintained value focus** - Every section ties back to CJCJ's credibility, December 1st deadline, and time savings
6. **Professional polish** - Consistent formatting, clear headers, scannable structure (can be read in 3-4 minutes)
7. **Action-oriented** - Ends with clear acceptance mechanism so they can sign immediately

The proposal now follows Jason Liu's complete framework while incorporating your specific pricing structure. The two-option approach is presented, but you're also offering the combined "Option 3" which bundles both at a discount—this is strategic because it anchors the higher value and makes the $9k option look like the smart choice (which it is for CJCJ given their December 1st deadline).
